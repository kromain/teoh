Teoh is a mobile multi-platform framework for connected multimedia apps!

Currently the main application is Teoh BM - an application that turns your phone/tablet in a baby monitor, and which can stream audio and/or video to remote receivers on a local network. These receivers can be a standard PC or another mobile device like a phone or tablet.

More to come soon!
